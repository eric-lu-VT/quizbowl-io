## Known Issues
- Some PDFs are just inherently messed up (spacing not preserved, misspellings in words that the program uses as key identifiers, weird formatting, etc.); as a result, the bot cannot read those PDFs.

## Roadmap
- Improve PDF reading
- Read "(#)" (the bot only reads "#." currently)
- Improve frontend appearance
- Add upload file (.docx and .pdf) from local machine rather than website 
- Add throughough user upload sanitation, for security purposes (especially if local machine file upload is to be added!)
